   (Tues.7/11/17) 
   Based on what we learned so far, some similarities between Python and Scratch is that you both need to use command phrases
   like "forward" or "pendown".Some differences between them is that Scratch is is a website, while Python is already with you
   on Mac, Windows, or Linux. In the beginning of debugging, it felt really complicated. <p>

    We learned that research always comes in handy! This week was really good. I worked with Catin, Reina, 
    Amanda, and Icenia. We all got along really nice and had a few laughs. <p>

    Based on the description of LaTeX, I think it's a programming language. A progamming language is is a formal language that specifies a set of 
    instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output. This relates to LaTeX because when you write acedemic output, you're looking for
    an output. (the answer) <p>
     
   
 (Mon. 8/1/17) I'm most proud most of learning "Dijkstra Algroithm" and actually understanding it. It's really quite easy, thank god 
      for Sisi. I found the onme we did, Dijkstra Algroithm was the most interesting because it reminded me of the map on my 
      garage wall. <p></h5>
