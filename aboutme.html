 <p> Daily Reflection (Tues.7/11/17) 
   Based on what we learned so far, some similarities between Python and Scratch iss that you both need to use command phrases like "forward" or "pendown". 
   Some differences between them is that Scratch is is a website, while Python is already with you on Mac, Windows, or Linux. 
   
   In the beginning of debugging, it felt really complicated. <p>
